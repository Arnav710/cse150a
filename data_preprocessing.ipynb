       "231878  Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. Repeat chest x ray2. Sputum culture and sensitivity.You have taken treatment (antibiotics) and still not improving, rather worsening, so we need to rule out worsening of infection by chest x ray.And in pneumonia, we should first identify the causative organism and than guide antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity report. So sputum culture and sensitivity report is needed to titrate antibiotics.Haphazard use of antibiotics should be avoided in pneumonia as it will increase drug resistance and delay the recovery.So consult pulmonologist and start appropriate antibiotics according to sensitivity report.  \n",

       "231878  thanks for your question on hcm.i can understand your situation and problem.in my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. repeat chest x ray2. sputum culture and sensitivity.you have taken treatment (antibiotics) and still not improving, rather worsening, so we need to rule out worsening of infection by chest x ray.and in pneumonia, we should first identify the causative organism and than guide antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity report. so sputum culture and sensitivity report is needed to titrate antibiotics.haphazard use of antibiotics should be avoided in pneumonia as it will increase drug resistance and delay the recovery.so consult pulmonologist and start appropriate antibiotics according to sensitivity report.  \n",
