       "201206  hi and welcome to healthcaremagic  thank you for your query  i am dr  rommstein  i understand your concerns and i will try to help you as much as i can this is serious disease and quitting alcohol is the most important thing that should be done  also  medications which are hematotoxic should be avoided  this is necessary to prevent disease progression  which is lethal in most cases  at early stages it can be treated with these measures but but in case of progression  only liver transplantation may help  diet should be balanced and healthy and get regular exercise  limit high carb foods such as bread  grits  rice  potatoes  and corn  and cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice  if there is viral hepatitis as udnelying cause then antiviral medications are required i hope i have answered you query  if you have any further questions you can contact us in every time kindly regards  wish you a good health   \n",
