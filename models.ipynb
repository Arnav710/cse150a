       "201206  hi and welcome to healthcaremagic  thank you for your query  i am dr  rommstein  i understand your concerns and i will try to help you as much as i can this is serious disease and quitting alcohol is the most important thing that should be done  also  medications which are hematotoxic should be avoided  this is necessary to prevent disease progression  which is lethal in most cases  at early stages it can be treated with these measures but but in case of progression  only liver transplantation may help  diet should be balanced and healthy and get regular exercise  limit high carb foods such as bread  grits  rice  potatoes  and corn  and cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice  if there is viral hepatitis as udnelying cause then antiviral medications are required i hope i have answered you query  if you have any further questions you can contact us in every time kindly regards  wish you a good health   \n",

      "Answer: hi thanks for writing in to us there are many causes of a shooting pain in the back of the head  commonly a neuralgia of the trigeminal nerve can cause such a condition  it has branches which supplies the back of the head  this can trigger sharp pains to the area  however a clinical examination is required to confirm the condition other causes of such pains can be from nerve pinching in the cervical spine  the nerves leave the spinal cord through small foramina and if there is cervical spine disc disease then the nerves are under pressure and can cause a sensation of sharp pain in the back of the head and neck regions pain below the ear can also happen due to inflammation of blood vessels called arteritis  usually temporal arteritis is a common cause of pain on the side of head and around the ear  please consult a neurologist for confirmation  please do not worry \n",
